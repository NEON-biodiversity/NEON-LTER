# NEON LTER

QDR, 30 May 2018

## Purpose of repository

This repository is for code written to do data processing, visualization, and analysis of NEON LTER data.

## Location of data

Most of the data is stored on MSU HPCC server. It may be necessary for collaborators to download the data files locally, then change the working directory at the top of each script.
All scripts should be written so that only one line at the top needs to be changed for the working directory to be changed. Other than that, the scripts are designed to be run with the working directory set to the local GitHub repository, so scripts that are sourced from this repo are not given an absolute file path.
